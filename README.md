# Predictive Modeling for Human Behavior Analysis

**[STATUS:Complete]**


**1. Motivation: A Humanitarian Manager's Perspective**

As a humanitarian Program Manager with over a decade of experience in high-stress environments like Haiti, Nigeria, and Cameroon, I've seen firsthand how high staff turnover can impact project continuity and team morale. The operational cost of replacing, training, and integrating new staff in the middle of a crisis response is immense. This project was born from that direct experience.

It translates a common business problem into the humanitarian context, where every resource—especially skilled personnel—is critical.

**2. Project Overview & Technical Depth**

This repository contains a data science project that builds a machine learning model to predict employee churn. The goal is to move from a reactive to a proactive approach in talent retention.

While the initial framework was inspired by a case study from the Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate, this analysis demonstrates a more advanced, production-ready approach. Here are specific examples that showcase this deeper level of analysis:

**Advanced Correlation Analysis:**

Instead of relying solely on standard Pearson correlation, this project implements more robust and nuanced methods:

*Spearman & Chatterjee Coefficients*: To capture non-linear relationships between variables, which are often missed by simpler models but are critical for understanding complex human behaviors.

*Comparative Correlation Heatmaps*: The analysis directly compares correlation matrices for employees who left versus those who stayed. This granular approach revealed that factors like average_montly_hours have a significantly different correlation with satisfaction_level depending on the employee group, providing a much deeper insight than a general correlation analysis would.

**Sophisticated Machine Learning Implementation:**
The project moves beyond basic modeling by:

*Implementing and Comparing Advanced Models:* It evaluates not just a standard Random Forest but also a Gradient Boosting model (XGBoost), which is known for its high performance in competitive and real-world scenarios.

*Strategic Metric Selection:* The model optimization focuses specifically on the Recall score. This is a deliberate strategic choice to minimize "False Negatives"—ensuring the model is best at identifying employees who are actually at risk, which is the most critical outcome for any retention strategy.

*Clear, Actionable Insights:* The final output isn't just a model score. It translates complex results into a clear summary of the top five drivers of employee churn, providing leadership with a direct, evidence-based roadmap for intervention.

These steps demonstrate a comprehensive, end-to-end data science workflow that goes beyond academic exercises to create a robust, interpretable, and strategically valuable tool.

**3. Broader Applications for the Humanitarian Sector**

The true value of this project lies in its methodology, which is highly adaptable to other critical areas of humanitarian work. The predictive analysis framework used here can be extended to:

Evaluate Training Effectiveness: Analyze post-training feedback and performance data to predict the long-term impact of capacity-building initiatives.

Assess Beneficiary Satisfaction: Model feedback from beneficiaries to identify communities or individuals at risk of disengaging from a program, allowing for timely intervention.

Enhance Field Surveys & Inquiries: Use predictive analytics on survey data (e.g., from Kobo Toolbox) to identify trends and predict outcomes related to food security, protection risks, or community needs before they escalate.

This project serves as a proof-of-concept for how data science can be a powerful tool for on-the-ground project managers, helping us make more informed, evidence-based decisions.

# Predictive Modeling for Human Behavior Analysis

**[STATUS: Part 1 - Exploratory Data Analysis Complete]**

### 1. Strategic Context: From Corporate Data to Humanitarian Insight

This project uses a classic "Employee Churn" dataset not as an end in itself, but as a methodological case study to demonstrate a **transferable analytical framework**. The core challengeâ€”understanding and predicting human behavior based on structured dataâ€”is universal and directly applicable to critical questions in the humanitarian sector.

The methodology developed here can be immediately adapted to:

* **ðŸ“ˆ Predict Vulnerability:** The same techniques used to identify employees at risk of leaving can be used to model the risk of a household falling into food insecurity or a beneficiary dropping out of a livelihood program.

* **ðŸ“Š Analyze Beneficiary Feedback:** This project provides a blueprint for deep analysis of survey data (e.g., PDM, baseline/endline studies). It moves beyond simple descriptive statistics to uncover the complex drivers behind beneficiary satisfaction, program success, or failure.

* **ðŸŽ¯ Optimize Resource Allocation:** The ultimate goal of this analysis is to enable targeted interventions. This mirrors the core task of humanitarian targeting: using data to direct limited resources to the people who need them most, maximizing impact and efficiency.

### 2. Case Study: Employee Churn Analysis

This repository contains the first part of an end-to-end analysis aimed at identifying the key factors driving employee churn. Using a dataset containing employee satisfaction levels, performance metrics, and work conditions, this initial phase focuses on a comprehensive **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**.

**The objective** is to clean, understand, and visualize the data to generate initial hypotheses about the drivers of churn, preparing the ground for the subsequent predictive modeling phase.

### 3. Key Questions Addressed in the EDA

This analysis seeks to answer foundational questions that inform strategic decision-making:

* What is the overall churn rate and how is it distributed across the organization?
* Are there significant correlations between an employee's performance evaluation, workload, and their decision to leave?
* How does job satisfaction influence retention, and are there specific thresholds of dissatisfaction that indicate a high risk of churn?
* Do events like workplace accidents or promotions have a measurable impact on employee retention?

### 5. Next Steps (Part Two)

The completed EDA provides the foundation for the next phase of the project:

* **Feature Engineering:** Creating new variables to better capture complex relationships.
* **Model Building:** Training and comparing several classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) to predict churn.
* **Model Evaluation & Interpretation:** Assessing model performance and extracting the most important predictive factors to provide actionable recommendations.
